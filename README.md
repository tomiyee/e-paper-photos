ESP32 and E-Paper Photo Frame

## Setup

This project was developed on a Linux environment. Specifically, the environment is WSL 2. It should not make a difference in setup, but if there are issues following the setup instructions, that could explain it. 

### 1. Install Arduino

To develop for the Arduino, we need to 

### 2. VS Code Extensions

This step is optional, depending on the preferred IDE. One could just as easily code using the Arduino IDE.

### 3. Hardware

I bought this 4.2 inch E-Paper module by Waveshare [here](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-2/4.2inch-e-paper-module.htm). 

The micro-controller I am using is an ESP32. 

At the product link on the Waveshare website, there are a variety of resources for using the device, such as example code for a variety of microcontrollers, like the ESP32 that I have.
